# Rubiks-Cube-Solver-Simulator
A graphical user interface that creates a rubiks cube on the screen whether in the solver or simulator mode and shows steps as to how to solve a given cube and simulator lets you play with it and scramble the cube.

This project was completed as my A-Level final project so it is not perfect. There are bugs and I am aware of them and I plan to one day recreate this project but in a much more complex way most likely utilising AI.
